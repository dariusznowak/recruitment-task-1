# recruitment-task-1
Recruitment task solution for front-end developer internship at Smart4Aviation.

## Development
This widget was created using **React.js** library.<br>
I used **CSS Flexbox** to achieve fully responsiveness.<br>
React useState hook helped me to store the application state.<br>
I also used simple regular expressions in specifying input labels.
